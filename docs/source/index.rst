Test Data Generator documentation
=================================

The Databricks Labs Test Data Generator project provides a convenient way to
generate large volumes of synthetic test data from within a Databricks notebook
(or regular Spark application).

By defining a test data generation spec, either in conjunction with an existing schema
or through creating a schema on the fly, you can control how test data is generated.

As the data generator generates a PYSpark data frame, it is simple to create a view over it to expose it
to Scala or R based Spark applications also.
