Multi table data and change data capture
========================================

See the section repeatable data generation for the concepts that underpin the data generation.

One common scenario is the need to be able to generate multiple tables
with consistent primary and foreign keys to model join or merge scenarios.

By generating tables with repeatable data, we can generate multiple versions of the same data for different tables and
ensure that we have referential integrity across the tables.

Examples to be added.
