.. Test Data Generator documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Sun Jun 21 10:54:30 2020.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Installation notes
==================

The data generator framework can be installed into your Databricks environment by
one of the following methods:

* Installation from PyPi package
* Installing and building directly from the Databricks Labs Github repository
* Installing the Python wheel file into your environment

Installing from PyPi
--------------------

To install the `dbldatagen` package from PyPi, add a cell to your notebook with the following code:

.. code-block::

   %pip install dbldatagen

This will install the PyPi package and works in regular notebooks, Delta Live Tables pipeline notebooks and works on
the community edition.

If working using the command line, you can issue the following command to install within your environment.

.. code-block::

   pip install dbldatagen


Installing from Databricks Labs repository source
-------------------------------------------------

When developing with the Databricks notebook environment, you can use the notebook scoped library install
 to install and build from the source in the Databricks Labs Github repository.

To do this add and execute the following cell at the start of your notebook:

.. code-block::

   %pip install git+https://github.com/databrickslabs/dbldatagen@current

By default, this will install a fresh build from latest release based on the ``master`` branch.
You can install from a specific branch by appending the branch identifier or tag to the github URL.

.. code-block::

   %pip install git+https://github.com/databrickslabs/dbldatagen@dbr_7_3_LTS_compat

The following tags will be used to pick up specific versions:

* `current` - latest build from master + doc changes and critical bug fixes
* `stable` - latest release from master (with changes for version marking and documentation only)
* `preview` - preview build of forthcoming features (from `develop` branch)

.. seealso::
   See the following links for more details:

   * `Azure documentation on notebook scoped libraries <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/libraries/notebooks-python-libraries#install-a-library-from-a-version-control-system-with-pip/>`_

   * `AWS documentation on notebook scoped libraries <https://docs.databricks.com/libraries/notebooks-python-libraries.html#id5>`_

   * `VCS support in pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/>`_

Installing from Github releases
-------------------------------

In some cases, you may wish to down the Python wheel directly from the Github releases.

These can be accessed `here <https://github.com/databrickslabs/dbldatagen/releases>`_.

You can install a specific wheel using either `%pip install` or the manual method

To install a Python wheel with `pip` use the following syntax:

.. code-block::

   %pip install https://github.com/databrickslabs/dbldatagen/releases/download/v021/dbldatagen-0.2.1-py3-none-any.whl

Replace the reference to the `v021` wheel with the reference to the appropriate wheel as needed

Manual installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* **locate the wheel file in the Databricks Labs data generator releases**

* **download the wheel artifact from the releases**
   * select the desired release
   * Select the wheel artifact from the release assets
   * download it

* **Create library entry in workspace**
   * create workspace library
   * upload previously downloaded wheel

* **Attach library to cluster**
