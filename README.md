## Project Description
This Databricks Labs project is a Python library for generating synthetic test data within the Databricks 
environment using Spark. It operates by defining a test data generation specification in code for how the test data is to be generated.

The specification may incorporate use of existing schemas, or create data in an adhoc fashion.

It has no dependencies on any libraries that are not already incuded in the Databricks 
runtime, and you can use it from Scala, R or other languages by defining
a view over the generated data.

It supports:
* Generating test data for all of the 
Spark SQL supported primitive types as a Spark data frame which may be persisted, 
saved to external storage or 
used in other computations
* Generating ranges of dates, timestamps and numeric values
* Generation of discrete values - both numeric and text
* Generation of values at random and based on the values of other fields 
(either based on the `hash` of the underlying values or the values themselves)
* Specifying 
* Generating arrays of values for ML style feature arrays
* Applying weights to the occurence of values
* Generating values to conform to a schema or independent of an existing schema
* use of SQL expressions in test data generation

 

## Project Support
Please note that all projects in the `databrickslabs` github space are provided for your exploration only, and are not formally supported by Databricks with Service Level Agreements (SLAs).  They are provided AS-IS and we do not make any guarantees of any kind.  Please do not submit a support ticket relating to any issues arising from the use of these projects.

Any issues discovered through the use of this project should be filed as GitHub Issues on the Repo.  They will be reviewed as time permits, but there are no formal SLAs for support.

## Compatibility
The code base must be built with Python 3.x. 

Either `pip` or `conda` can be used for building.

For full library compatibility for a specific Databricks Spark release, see the Databricks 
release notes for library compatibility

- https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/releases.html

# Using a pre-built release
The release binaries can be accessed at:
- Github Test Data Generator releases - https://github.com/databrickslabs/data-generator/releases

To use download a wheel file and install using the Databricks install mechanism to install a wheel based
library into your workspace.

Latest pre-release is code complete and fully functional barring some issues with generation of date ranges. 

# Building the code

Our recommended mechanism for building the code is to use a conda based development process. 

To use this, perform the following commands:
  - `make create-dev-env` from the main project directory
  - activate the conda environment - e.g `conda activate dbl_testdatagenerator`
  - install the necessary dependencies in your conda environment via `make install-dev-dependencies`
  
  use the following to build and run the tests with a coverage report
  - Run  ` make test-with-html-report` from the main project directory.

Use the following command to make the distributable:
  - Run `make dist` from the main project directory
  - The resulting wheel file will be placed in the `dist` subdirectory
  
## Creating the HTML documentation

Run  `make docs` from the main project directory.

The main html document will be in the file (relative to the root of the build directory) `./python/docs/docs/build/html/index.html`

## Running unit tests

If using an environment with multiple Python versions, make sure to use virtual env or similar to pick up correct python versions.

If necessary, set `PYSPARK_PYTHON` and `PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON` to point to correct versions of Python.

Run  `make tests` from the main project directory to run the unit tests.

## Using the Project
To use the project, the generated wheel should be installed in your Python notebook as a wheel based library

Once the library has been installed, you can use it to generate a test data frame.

For example

```buildoutcfg
df_spec = (datagen.DataGenerator(sparkSession=spark, name="test_data_set1", rows=cls.row_count,
                                                  partitions=4)
                            .withIdOutput()
                            .withColumn("r", FloatType(), expr="floor(rand() * 350) * (86400 + 3600)",
                                        numColumns=cls.column_count)
                            .withColumn("code1", IntegerType(), min=100, max=200)
                            .withColumn("code2", IntegerType(), min=0, max=10)
                            .withColumn("code3", StringType(), values=['a', 'b', 'c'])
                            .withColumn("code4", StringType(), values=['a', 'b', 'c'], random=True)
                            .withColumn("code5", StringType(), values=['a', 'b', 'c'], random=True, weights=[9, 1, 1])

                            )
                            
df = df_spec.build()
num_rows=df.count()                          
```
