## Project Description
The `dbldatgen` Databricks Labs project is a Python library for generating synthetic data within the Databricks 
environment using Spark. The generated data may be used for testing, benchmarking, demos and many 
other uses.

It operates by defining a data generation specification in code that controls 
how the synthetic data is to be generated.
The specification may incorporate use of existing schemas, or create data in an adhoc fashion.

It has no dependencies on any libraries that are not already incuded in the Databricks 
runtime, and you can use it from Scala, R or other languages by defining
a view over the generated data.

### Feature Summary
It supports:
* Generating synthetic data at scale up to billions of rows within minutes using appropriately sized clusters 
* Generating repeatable, predictable data supporting the needs for producing multiple tables, Change Data Capture, 
merge and join scenarios with consistency between primary and foreign keys
* Generating synthetic data for all of the 
Spark SQL supported primitive types as a Spark data frame which may be persisted, 
saved to external storage or 
used in other computations
* Generating ranges of dates, timestamps and numeric values
* Generation of discrete values - both numeric and text
* Generation of values at random and based on the values of other fields 
(either based on the `hash` of the underlying values or the values themselves)
* Ability to specify a distribution for random data generation 
* Generating arrays of values for ML style feature arrays
* Applying weights to the occurrence of values
* Generating values to conform to a schema or independent of an existing schema
* use of SQL expressions in test data generation
* plugin mechanism to allow use of 3rd party libraries such as Faker
* Use within a Databricks Delta Live Tables pipeline as a synthetic data generation source

Details of these features can be found in the online documentation  -
 [online documentation](https://databrickslabs.github.io/dbldatagen/public_docs/index.html). 

## Documentation

Please refer to the [online documentation](https://databrickslabs.github.io/dbldatagen/public_docs/index.html) for 
details of use and many examples.

Release notes and details of the latest changes for this specific release
can be found in the Github repository
[here](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dbldatagen/blob/release/v0.3.0/CHANGELOG.md)

# Installation

Use `pip install dbldatagen` to install the PyPi package

Within a Databricks notebook, invoke the following in a notebook cell
```commandline
%pip install dbldatagen
```

This can be invoked within a Databricks notebook, a Delta Live Tables pipeline and even works on the Databricks 
community edition.

The documentation [installation notes](https://databrickslabs.github.io/dbldatagen/public_docs/installation_notes.html) 
contains details of installation using alternative mechanisms.

## Compatibility 
The Databricks Labs data generator framework can be used with Pyspark 3.1.2 and Python 3.8 or later. These are 
compatible with the Databricks runtime 9.1 LTS and later releases.

Older prebuilt releases are tested against Pyspark 3.0.1 (compatible with the Databricks runtime 7.3 LTS 
or later) and built with Python 3.7.5

For full library compatibility for a specific Databricks Spark release, see the Databricks 
release notes for library compatibility

- https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/releases.html

## Using the Data Generator
To use the data generator, install the library using the `%pip install` method or install the Python wheel directly 
in your environment.

Once the library has been installed, you can use it to generate a data frame composed of synthetic data.

For example

```buildoutcfg
import dbldatagen as dg
from pyspark.sql.types import IntegerType, FloatType, StringType
column_count = 10
data_rows = 1000 * 1000
df_spec = (dg.DataGenerator(spark, name="test_data_set1", rows=data_rows,
                                                  partitions=4)
                            .withIdOutput()
                            .withColumn("r", FloatType(), 
                                             expr="floor(rand() * 350) * (86400 + 3600)",
                                             numColumns=column_count)
                            .withColumn("code1", IntegerType(), minValue=100, maxValue=200)
                            .withColumn("code2", IntegerType(), minValue=0, maxValue=10)
                            .withColumn("code3", StringType(), values=['a', 'b', 'c'])
                            .withColumn("code4", StringType(), values=['a', 'b', 'c'], 
                                           random=True)
                            .withColumn("code5", StringType(), values=['a', 'b', 'c'], 
                                           random=True, weights=[9, 1, 1])

                            )
                            
df = df_spec.build()
num_rows=df.count()                          
```
