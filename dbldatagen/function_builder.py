        Makes cumulative distribution function probabilities for each value in values list.

        a cumulative distribution function for discrete values can uses
        a  table of cumulative probabilities to evaluate different expressions
        based on the cumulative  probability of each value occurring

        The probabilities can be computed from the weights using the code::

           weight_interval = 1.0 / total_weights
           probs = [x * weight_interval for x in weights]
           return reduce((lambda x, y: cls._mk_list(x) + [cls._last_element(x) + y]), probs)

        but Python provides built-in methods (itertools.accumulate) to compute the accumulated weights
        and dividing each resulting accumulated weight by the sum of the total weights will give the cumulative
        probabilities.

        For large data sets (relative to number of values), tests verify that the resulting distribution is
        within 10% of the expected distribution when using Spark SQL Rand() as a uniform random number generator.
        In testing, test data sets of size 3000 * number_of_values rows produce a distribution within 10% of expected ,
        while datasets of size 10,000 x `number of values` gives a repeated
        distribution within 5% of expected distribution.

        :param weights: List of weights to compute CDF probabilities for
        :returns: List of CDF probabilities

        Example code to be generated (pseudo code)::

           # given values value1 .. valueN, prob1 to probN
           # cdf_probabilities = [ prob1, prob1+prob2, ... prob1+prob2+prob3 .. +probN]
           # this will then be used as follows

           prob_occurrence = uniform_rand(0.0, 1.0)
           if prob_occurrence <= cdf_prob_value1 then value1
           elif prob_occurrence <= cdf_prob_value2 then value2
           ...
           prob_occurrence <= cdf_prob_valueN then valueN
           else valueN

        """
        total_weights = sum(weights)
        return [x / total_weights for x in itertools.accumulate(weights)]
